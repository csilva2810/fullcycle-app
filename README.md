# Full cycle application

This application is beeing developed for the [fullcycle imersion event](https://evento.imersao.fullcycle.com.br)

## Description

The idea is to build a fullstack application using technologies like Docker, Go, Nest.js, Kafka, and React. When the application is ready, we will deploy it using Kubernetes and then use tools for observability.
It is based on the [Netflix's Full Cycle](https://netflixtechblog.com/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249) methodology in which the developer is reponsible for all the software lifecycle which is composed by Design, Develop, Test, Deploy, Operate, and Support stages.
